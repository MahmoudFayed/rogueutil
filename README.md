# Rogueutil
Rogueutil is a cross-platform C/C++ (Windows and *nix at least) utility for
creating text-based user interfaces (TUI) and console-based games.

# Quick Start
Simply include `rogueutil.h` somewhere in your source code. It will automatically detect if
you are using C or C++.

# Documentation
Either read the source code for the comments or see the API reference located
in docs/html/rogueutil8h.html
